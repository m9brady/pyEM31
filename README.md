# pyEM31

This codebase was initiated by the late Dr. Josh King at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) with support from Dr. Christian Haas at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI). This effort is being continued by Mike Brady (ECCC) and being made available to the general science community and the public.
